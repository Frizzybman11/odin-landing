# odin-landing
This is an assignment for The Odin Project!

It contains one webpage, a landing page filled with placeholder information.

The page has a header, a body with four sections, and a footer.

The four sections of the body are:
<ul>
    <li>A hero section with a title/subtitle, a sign up button, and an image.</li>
    <li>An information section with four pictures and subtitles.</li>
    <li>A quotation section.</li>
    <li>A 'Sign-Up' banner.</li>
</ul>
This webpage was designed from-scratch following a sample image of what the webpage should look like.

This project gave me experience with:
<ul>
    <li>Implementing Flexbox! Every section of the page is formatted with flexbox.</lo>
    <li>Designing the full HTML layout of a webpage, dividing the page with div tags as needed for flexbox to work properly.</li>
    <li>Creating and customizing the CSS as needed for the webpage to resemble the sample image.</li>
</ul>
