# odin-landing
This is an assignment for The Odin Project!

It contains one webpage, a landing page filled with placeholder information.

The page has a header, a body with four sections, and a footer.

The four sections of the body are:
    -A hero section with a title/subtitle, a sign up button, and an image.
    -An information section with four pictures and subtitles.
    -A quotation section.
    -A 'Sign-Up' banner.

This webpage was designed from-scratch following a sample image of what the webpage should look like.

This project gave me experience with:
    -Implementing Flexbox! Every section of the page is formatted with flexbox.
    -Designing the full HTML layout of a webpage, dividing the page with <div> tags as needed for flexbox to work properly.
    -Creating and customizing the CSS as needed for the webpage to resemble the sample image.
